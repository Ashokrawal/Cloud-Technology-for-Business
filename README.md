3. Current IT setup 

3.1 Hardware
 
On-premises Servers:

BookShow’s IT infrastructure includes several key components. The web servers host the website and application, handling user inquiries, ticket bookings, and providing web content, typically using software like Apache and Nginx (Nginx, n.d.; Apache HTTP Server Project, n.d.). The database servers are dedicated to storing and managing transactional data, customer information, and event details, utilizing relational database management systems like SQL Server or PostgreSQL (Microsoft SQL Server, n.d.; PostgreSQL, n.d.). Media servers are employed for streaming media content and storing large media files. Backup servers ensure critical data backup and data availability during power outages. In addition to other features, hardware load balancers are utilized to ensure that web traffic is evenly distributed to web servers, resulting in high availability and reliability.

3.2 Software

Operating Systems:

The operating systems primarily used are Linux servers, such as Ubuntu and CentOS, chosen for their reliability and security, and deployed across web, database, and media servers. BookShow utilizes several key applications and services to ensure smooth operations. A custom ticketing platform is  specialized software that manages ticket bookings, user profiles, financial transactions, and event organization. CRM (Customer Relationship Management) will manage interactions with customers, sales, and support. Content management system 'CMS' ,  manages website content management, promotions,  advertising. Integration of APIs and services with multiple payment gateways to support online transactions. Additionally, Server health and performance are monitored using monitoring tools like Nagios and Zabbix. (Nagios, n.d.; Zabbix, n.d.).


3.3 Internet Connectivity and Network Hardware

With high-bandwidth connections, BookShow guarantees dependable internet access to manage heavy user traffic levels. Furthermore, switches and routers are utilised to provide uninterrupted network communication both inside and outside (Cisco, n.d.). 

3.4 Security Components

BookShow secures its infrastructure using a number of security methods. A software firewall is used to protect the network from unwanted access, whereas a hardware firewall is used to protect the system from external cyber threats. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) and an intrusion detection system (IDS) watch network traffic in order to identify unusual behaviour and stop any assaults. In order to guarantee ongoing service availability, steps are also made to lessen the effects of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assaults.

3.5 Power and Cooling

In the event of a power loss, BookShow employs a UPS as a backup power source to keep the server operational. In order to keep servers and network equipment working at their ideal temperatures, a cooling system is also used. 

4. On-Site Management and Maintenance

4.1 IT Staff and Support Team

The IT department at BookShow is responsible for maintaining and supporting essential services and infrastructure through specialized positions. System administrators monitor network hardware, servers, and storage systems to ensure consistent and smooth operation. Database administrators manage database servers by focusing on improving performance and maintaining data integrity. Network administrators are responsible for both maintaining network connections and implementing security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Moreover, dedicated support workers provide technical help to end users, ensuring efficient use of IT resources throughout the entire company.

4.2 Monitoring

To guarantee the best server and network performance, BookShow employs both human monitoring by IT specialists and automatic monitoring technologies like Nagios and Zabbix. Regular system inspections are carried out by IT staff to ensure system operation and to quickly resolve any issues that may develop. Furthermore, real-time alerts and dashboards are features of monitoring systems that enable proactive administration of server and network activities. BookShow may increase system performance and availability by combining two strategies to cut down on downtime and boost overall operational effectiveness.
